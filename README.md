## Introduction
Hello! I'm [@AnySpy](https://github.com/AnySpy), a Comp. Sci major at Missouri State University! I have an interest in game development and task automation.

## Cool projects
I am working on a [World of Warcraft clone](https://github.com/AnySpy/WoWClone) currently! It's going to be completely singleplayer and free, this is my long-term project that I work on as I can.

[PGN-to-Text](https://github.com/AnySpy/PGN-to-Text) is one that I made because I was batch making PGN.txt files for copying to Lichess and it got annoying naming them by myself.

[Hotspot Manager](https://github.com/AnySpy/HotspotManager) I made because Windows 11 loves to turn off the hotspot automatically, even with devices connected. It's a ps1 script that just, silently, turns the hotspot back on.
