## Introduction
Hello! I'm [@AnySpy](https://github.com/AnySpy), a Comp. Sci major at Missouri State University! I have an interest in game development and task automation.

## Cool projects
I am creating a website for my school's birding club! It's static HTML and developed using Astro and deployed with GitHub Pages. Check the live version out [here](www.thebirdclubmsu.com) or look at the repo [here](https://github.com/AnySpy/bird-club).

I am working on a [World of Warcraft clone](https://github.com/AnySpy/WoWClone) currently! It's going to be completely singleplayer and free, this is my long-term project that I work on as I can.

[Hotspot Manager](https://github.com/AnySpy/HotspotManager) I made because Windows 11 loves to turn off the hotspot automatically, even with devices connected. It's a ps1 script that just, silently, turns the hotspot back on.
